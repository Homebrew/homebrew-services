# Homebrew Services (deprecated)

This tap allowed you to manage background services using the daemon manager `launchctl` on macOS or `systemctl` on Linux.

It has been moved to [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew).

`brew services` still works as before, it just isn't in this tap any more.
